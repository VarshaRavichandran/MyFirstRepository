[MUI datatable for react](https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables) is used for the asset table creation. Features like pagination, sorting and filtering are supported in this table.

Operations provided on the asset table include creation of assets, uploading asset information as CSV, filtering, custom selection of columns to be displayed and global search which are all part of CustomToolbar.

Additional features like deletion of assets(on selecting one or more rows) and editing an asset's informatin(on selecting strictly one row) are available in CustomToolbarSelect.

On clicking any asset on the table, all other information pertaining to that particular asset can be viewed.
